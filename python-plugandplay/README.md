Diyu Yang and Prof. Charles A. Bouman

Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
## Overview
This python package implements deep proximal map model and related experiments (ML estimation, Plug and play reconstruction) for various inverse imaging problems.

## Prerequisite
Python 3.6

Keras 2.2.4

Tensorflow 1.12.0 (GPU support is only necessary if you want to retrain the deep proximal map models)

scikit-image

matplotlib

Cython

## Code structure
### experiments/
This directory contains all the experiment code for both linear and nonlinear forward model case.
